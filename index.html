                   Currently finishing a Sudoku solver that generates a Sudoku puzzle that can be solved based on a selectable 
                    difficulty level.It uses a backtracking algorithm and a dancing link algorithm to solve and create the puzzles. 
                    The dancing Links are significantly faster than backtracking.
                   Another project is an Automated Weather Bot for Twitter. This Fetches the current weather for my home town of Marysville,
                    Washington and it posts on my Twitter the current weather. I used the Twitter4j and Open Weather API to post automatically to Twitter and to   
                    fetch the weather data respectively.
