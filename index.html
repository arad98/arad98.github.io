                   Currently helping Caleb Trujillo with developing a R program to sort and visualize various user surveys for the summer. 
                    Some of the projects I have developed are a Sudoku Solver with two separate algorithms to show the difference in puzzle solve speed. 
                    I used Java and Spring Boot to visualize the puzzles being solved.Another project is an Automated Weather Bot for Twitter. 
                    This Fetches the current weather for my hometown of Marysville, Washington and it posts on my Twitter the current weather. 
                    I used the Twitter4j and Open Weather API to post automatically to Twitter and to fetch the weather data respectively.
